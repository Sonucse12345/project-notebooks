    "# How to fine-tune a T5 model with ONNX Runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "[ONNX Runtime](https://microsoft.github.io/onnxruntime/) includes optimized kernels for GPU execution and efficient GPU memory management. With ONNX Runtime Training integrated, we expect a speedup on training(up to 37% increase in training throughput over PyTorch and up to 86% speedup when combined with DeepSpeed). Besides, ORT Training allows running 2X batch size compared with PyTorch.  \n",
    "\n",
    "[Optimum](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum) library, as an extention of [Transfermers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)ðŸ¤—, offers an `ORTTrainer` API for users to easily leverage ONNX Runtime as backend for the accerleration on the training as well as inference of models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will walk through the fine-tuning of [T5](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/t5) model in the ðŸ¤— Transformers for a summarization task. We will use the [XSum](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.08745.pdf) dataset (for extreme summarization) which contains BBC articles accompanied with single-sentence summaries, and the training as well as inference will be done by applying `ORTTrainer`! \n",
